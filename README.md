I started using the same dataset from assignment 1 
I isolated the year column in the dataset to get the max year 
Next, I subtracted the whole year column with the max year number 
I then converted the salary figure from USD to Euros using a conversion factor or 1 USD = .82 Euros
After multiplying the salaries by .82 to get the figures in euros, I named the new column salaries(Euro) and added them to the primary dataset
Finally, I saved the new dataset as a CSV file
